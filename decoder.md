1. generate word embeddings
   my question: During the training of the weights of word embeddings, how to make the training convert?\
   what is the target value? To answer this question, check this video later https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viZrOnJclY0
2. position encoding
3. decoder-only transformers (also called auto-regressive transformers)
   it uses a masked self-attention which only pays attention to the current word and the preceding words. 
   * To learn the way to calculate words similarities other than dot similarities, check the video cosine similarity
   * also check the video attention for neural networks
